Breaking down the task of cleaning your room into tiny bits:

1.  Make your bed: Straighten the sheets, fluff the pillows, and fold any blankets.
2.  Clear the floor: Pick up any clothes, shoes, or other items lying on the floor and put them in their designated spots.
3.  Organize clothes: Fold or hang any clean clothes and put them away. Put dirty clothes in a hamper or laundry basket.
4.  Declutter surfaces: Remove any clutter from your desk, nightstand, and other surfaces. Put items back in their proper places or find new homes for them.
5.  Dust and wipe: Wipe down surfaces like your desk, shelves, and nightstand with a damp cloth to remove dust and dirt.
6.  Vacuum or sweep: Once the floor is clear of items, vacuum or sweep to remove dust and dirt.
7.  Empty the trash: Take out any garbage or recycling and replace the bin liners.
8.  Organize items: Make sure everything has a designated place and put things back where they belong.
9.  Rearrange: If you feel inspired, rearrange furniture or items to make your room feel fresh and new.
10. Final touches: Light a candle or spray air freshener for a fresh scent. Take a step back and admire your clean and organized space.
